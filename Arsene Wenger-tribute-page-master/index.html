          <p>Arsène Charles Ernest Wenger OBE (French pronunciation: ​[aʁsɛn vɛŋɡɛʁ]; born 22 October 1949) is a French former football manager and player, who is FIFA's Chief of Global Football Development. He was the manager of Arsenal from 1996 to 2018, where he was the longest-serving and most successful in the club's history. His contribution to English football through changes to scouting, players' training, and diet regimens revitalised Arsenal and aided the globalisation of the sport in the 21st century.</p>
          <p>"In August 1996, Arsenal dismissed Bruce Rioch as club manager.[94] Rioch's position had become untenable after a dispute with the board over transfers, and his working relationship with Dein worsened during the course of his tenure.[94] Arsenal appointed Stewart Houston and later Pat Rice in temporary charge of the first team, while they searched for a full-time successor.[95] Although Barcelona player and manager Johan Cruyff was favourite to take over,[96] the board looked elsewhere, eventually backing Dein's proposal to hire Wenger.[97] The appointment was delayed for several weeks as Wenger was under contract at Nagoya Grampus and the club wanted time to make a final decision.[98] In the meantime the Arsenal board refused to confirm the identity of their next manager, but speculation grew that it would be Wenger once the club signed French midfielders Patrick Vieira and Rémi Garde.[99] On 22 September 1996, Wenger was unveiled as Arsenal manager, after Nagoya Grampus granted him his release.[100] He officially assumed the role on 1 October 1996.[101] At his first press conference, he told reporters: "The main reason for coming is that I love English football, the roots of the game are here. I like the spirit round the game and at Arsenal I like the spirit of the club and its potential.""</p>
          <p>At Arsenal, Wenger has enjoyed a great deal of support and backing from the club board of directors, who have demonstrated exceptional faith in the manager and his long-term vision.[357] His arrival at the club prompted a change in their football style – once derided as "boring, boring Arsenal" for a lack of creativity,[358] pundit Alan Hansen described the 2004 team as "quite simply the most fluid, devastating team the British Isles has seen".[359] Brian Clough once quipped: "Arsenal caress a football the way I dreamed of caressing Marilyn Monroe".[citation needed] Wenger himself reflected that his greatest legacy at Arsenal would be the style he implemented.[360] Supporters regularly display banners such as "Arsène knows" and "In Arsène we trust" during home matches, though there have been a growing number of protests against his management</p>
